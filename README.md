# BlackFang APT Repository

This is the custom APT repository for the BlackFang OS project â€” a privacy-focused, security-oriented Debian-based distribution.

This repository is used to host a small set of custom tools and utilities developed specifically for BlackFang OS. It does not aim to replace or mirror Debian/Kali repositories. Those should still be enabled alongside this one for normal system operation.

```
deb [trusted=yes] https://kra1t0.github.io/blackfang-apt blackfang main
```

## Project Status

This repository is part of an ongoing project and is still under development. Expect changes, updates, and improvements over time.
